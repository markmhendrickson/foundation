# Setup Foundation Symlinks

Sets up symlinks from foundation cursor rules and commands to `.cursor/` directory.

## Command

```
setup-symlinks
```

or

```
setup symlinks
```

## Purpose

This command runs the foundation symlinks script (`foundation/scripts/setup-cursor-rules.sh`) which:

1. Creates symlinks from `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-rules/` to `.cursor/rules/`
2. Creates symlinks from `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-commands/` to `.cursor/commands/`
3. Prefixes all symlink names with `foundation-` to avoid conflicts
4. Removes existing foundation symlinks before creating new ones
5. Preserves any non-symlink files (custom rules/commands)

## When to Use

- After installing foundation for the first time
- After updating foundation submodule (to refresh symlinks)
- When cursor rules/commands are not working (symlinks may be broken)
- When you want to ensure symlinks are up to date

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Foundation Directory

**Check if foundation exists:**

- Look for `foundation/` directory in repo root
- If not found, check `../foundation/` (parent directory)
- If still not found, error: "Foundation directory not found. Please ensure foundation is installed."

### Step 2: Run Setup Script

**Execute the script:**

```bash
./foundation/scripts/setup-cursor-rules.sh
```

**Or if foundation is in parent directory:**

```bash
../foundation/scripts/setup-cursor-rules.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify Results

**Check output:**

- Script should report number of rules linked
- Script should report number of commands linked
- Check `.cursor/rules/` for `foundation-*.md` symlinks
- Check `.cursor/commands/` for `foundation-*.md` symlinks

**Expected output:**

```
[INFO] Setting up cursor rules and commands...
[INFO] Foundation directory: foundation
[INFO] Creating symlinks for generic cursor rules...
  ✓ Linked security.md -> foundation-security.md
  ✓ Linked worktree_env.md -> foundation-worktree_env.md
  ...
[INFO] Creating symlinks for generic cursor commands...
  ✓ Linked commit.md -> foundation-commit.md
  ✓ Linked analyze.md -> foundation-analyze.md
  ...
[INFO] ✅ Cursor rules setup complete!
[INFO]   Rules linked: X
[INFO]   Commands linked: Y
```

## What Gets Created

**Symlinks in `.cursor/rules/`:**
- `foundation-security.md` → `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-rules/security.md`
- `foundation-worktree_env.md` → `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-rules/worktree_env.md`
- `foundation-readme_maintenance.md` → `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-rules/readme_maintenance.md`
- ... (all rules from foundation)

**Symlinks in `.cursor/commands/`:**
- `foundation-commit.md` → `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-commands/commit.md`
- `foundation-analyze.md` → `foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-commands/analyze.md`
- ... (all commands from foundation)

## Behavior

**Symlink Prefix:**
- All symlinks are prefixed with `foundation-` to avoid conflicts
- Example: `security.md` becomes `foundation-security.md`

**Existing Files:**
- If a file already exists (not a symlink), it's preserved
- Script skips creating symlink to preserve customizations
- To replace with foundation version, manually remove the file first

**Existing Symlinks:**
- All existing `foundation-*.md` symlinks are removed first
- New symlinks are created fresh
- Ensures symlinks point to current foundation version

## Error Handling

### Foundation Directory Not Found

**Error:**
```
[ERROR] Foundation directory not found. Please run from repository root or ensure foundation is installed.
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're in repository root
- Verify foundation is installed (as submodule or symlink)
- Check if foundation is in parent directory

### Cursor Rules Directory Not Found

**Error:**
```
[ERROR] Cursor rules directory not found: foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-rules
```

**Solution:**
- Verify foundation submodule is initialized: `git submodule update --init`
- Check that foundation has cursor rules directory

### Cursor Commands Directory Not Found

**Error:**
```
[ERROR] Cursor commands directory not found: foundation/agent-instructions/cursor-commands
```

**Solution:**
- Verify foundation submodule is initialized: `git submodule update --init`
- Check that foundation has cursor commands directory

## Notes

- This command is generic and works for any repo using foundation as submodule
- Symlinks ensure single source of truth (foundation)
- Updates to foundation automatically apply to symlinked rules/commands
- Custom rules/commands (non-symlink files) are preserved
- Symlink prefix prevents conflicts with repository-specific rules/commands
